The first released version of the Nordic44 model was published in the following paper, with the following authors:
L. Vanfretti, S.H. Olsen, V.S. Narasimham Arava, G. Laera, A. Bidadfar, T. Rabuzin, S. H. Jakobsen, J. Lavenius, M. Baudette and F.J. Gómez-López, “An Open Data Repository and a Data Processing Software Toolset of an Equivalent Nordic Grid Model Matched to Historical Electricity Market Data,” Data in Brief (Elsevier), February 17th 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2017.02.021
The original PSSE based model was provided by Emil Hillberg at STRI (https://www.stri.se/).

The original Nordic44 model was created to support static power flow and dynamic stability analysis under relevant marked condition for the nordic power system based on the market data published by Nord Pool (https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/en/). It was trained and validated for all electricity market's operation hours during 2015 with power flow and dynamic response. The result was used to train and test Machine Learning techniques (e.g. Decision Trees) and other computational techniques that
are essential in the work flows used for dynamic security assessment of electrical power systems.
